So its public now cuz I'm leaving Bot Development.

How to run:

> Do The basic stuff (creating a application at discord.dev)

> Fill config.json

> Install NodeJS latest version in your Machine.

> In Your Shell type `npm i`

> Then after installation, use `node .` and done. Bot is online.


```js
NOTE: I STILL HAVE CODE LICENSE. 
YOU CANNOT USE THIS AS YOUR PUBLIC BOT!
BETTER TO READ `LICENSE` FILE.
```

Enjoy :)
